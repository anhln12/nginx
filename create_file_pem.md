create_file_pem


Open a text editor (such as wordpad) and paste the entire body of each certificate into one text file in the following order:
```
The Private Key - your_domain_name.key
The Primary Certificate - your_domain_name.crt
The Intermediate Certificate - DigiCertCA.crt
The Root Certificate - TrustedRoot.crt
Make sure to include the beginning and end tags on each certificate. The result should look like this:

----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
(Your Private Key: your_domain_name.key)
-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
(Your Primary SSL certificate: your_domain_name.crt) ⇒ certificate.crt
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
(Your Intermediate certificate: DigiCertCA.crt) ⇒ 1.Root CA.cer
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
(Your Root certificate: TrustedRoot.crt) ⇒ 2.intermediate.crt.cer
-----END CERTIFICATE----
```
